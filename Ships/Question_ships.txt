Question One [50 marks]

This question concerns calculating the point of intersection of two lines and then determining which of two points is closest to it.
Two ships, S1, S2, are on straight line courses that intersect at a point (Xi, Yi).

Ship S1's course is represented by the equation
ax+ay + c1 = 0.

Ship S2's course is represented by the equation a2x+a2y + c2 = 0.

The intersection point, (Xi, Yi), may be calculated from a1, b1, c1 and a2, b2, and c2.

Xi = (b1c2 - b2c1)/(a1b2-a2b1)

Yi= (a2c1 - a1c2)/(a1b2 - a2b1)

The ships S1, S2 are currently at points (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) respectively.

Which ship is nearest the intersection point?

The distance between two points (Xa, Ya) and (Xb, Yb) is V((Xa-xb)^2 + (Ya-Yb)^2).

Write a program called 'Ships. java' that accepts as input the name of a text file where each pair of lines contains data on a pair of ships, S1 and S2, on intersecting courses. For each pair it will output the intersection point and the ship that is closest to it. If the difference between the ships' respective distances (from the intersection point) is less than 0.5 then it's considered a tie.
The input file consists of pairs of lines with the following format:
a1 b1 c1 x1 y1
a2 b2 c2 x2 y2

The first line of each pair contains space-separated values for ship S1, and the second contains space-separated values for ship S2.
Sample File ('ships.txt'):
1 2 1 -3 1
2 3 5 1 2.33
1 0 -10 10 9
0 1 -10 9 10

The sample file contains two pairs of lines, In the first pair, ship S1's course is x+2y+1 and its current position is (-3, 1), and ship Sa's course is 2x+3y+5 and its current position is (1, 2.33). In the second pair, ship S1's course is x+0y-10 and its current position is (10, 9), and ship S2's course is Ox+y-10 and its current position is (9, 10).

Sample I/O:
Enter the name of the ship data file:
ships.txt
Pair 1: Intersection point: (-7.0,3.0); Ship S1's distance is 4.5;Ship S2's distance is 8.0; Ship S1 is nearest.
Pair 2: Intersection point: (10.0,10.0); Ship S1's distance is 1.0;Ship S2's distance is 1.0; Tied.
Done

All numbers are printed to one decimal place.

HINT:
• The value of the expression 
String. format ("%.2f", 5.759) is the string "5.76".
• A java.util.Scanner object can be used to read a java. 1o. File.
• The String split () method or a java.util. Scanner object can be used to break up a line into parts.
• The Double parseDouble() method or a Scanner object can be used to obtain the double value of a String of digits.
• Java implements the IEEE 754 standard for floating point arithmetic, which permits -0.0. Adding 0.0 to a floating point value will produce the result 0.0 in the case that it is  -0.0 and will have no effect in any other case.

NOTE:
• Your program may NOT read the contents of the ship data text file more than once.
