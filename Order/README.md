# Question Two [50 marks]

Write a program called 'Order.java' that accepts as input the name of a text file containing lines of words. For each line it will determine the length of the longest sub sequence where the words are in alphabetical order.

Given the line 'the rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain', for example, the longest sub sequence is 'falls mainly on the', which is length 4. Given the line 'how now brown cow', it's a tie, the longest sequences are 'how now and 'brown cow'.

#### Sample File ('lines.txt'):
<code>how now brown cow
the rain in spain falls mainly on the plain hello
</code>

#### Sample I/O:
<code>Enter the name of the word lists text file: lines.txt
Multiple solutions length 2.
Longest is 4.
Longest is 1.
Done</code>
